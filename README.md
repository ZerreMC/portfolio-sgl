# CV Portfolio Project

## Project Analysis

### User Profile
The primary target user for this portfolio is a recruiter or hiring manager at a tech company who is looking to assess the potential of a university student for a front-end development role. This user expects to find clear and relevant information on the candidate's skills, academic background, and any technical proficiencies, as well as contact information to initiate potential interviews. The website is also aimed at technical leads or developers at companies who may want to evaluate the candidate for collaboration or internship opportunities.

### Information Architecture
The information on this single-page portfolio is structured to provide a seamless user experience. The page begins with a **Header** containing a navigation menu that links to key sections like "Home," "About Me," "Stack," and "Contact." The header also features a button for language switching (ENG/CAT) to reach a broader audience. The **Main Section (Hero)** introduces the user with a personalized greeting and a concise description of the user's field of study. This section includes action buttons for downloading the CV in PDF format and navigating to the contact section.

The **‘About Me’** section provides a summary of the user’s academic background, interests, and motivations. The **‘Technical Skills’** section categorizes the user’s qualifications, showcasing front-end languages, basic backend knowledge, and other relevant tools used in development. Lastly, the **‘Contact’** section invites users to reach out, presenting a friendly message along with icons that link to LinkedIn, GitHub, and an email contact form. The **Footer** section at the top of the page includes a copyright note that adds a professional touch to the site.

### Visual Design
The visual design of the portfolio is built to reflect modern web development aesthetics. A dark color palette with neon-style gradients was chosen to create a striking yet professional look that mirrors the design seen in blockchain and tech-related projects. This color scheme was inspired by the need to capture attention while maintaining readability and a sense of professionalism.

Typography is critical for user engagement and readability, and this project employs sans-serif fonts that offer a modern, clean appearance. Astro was selected for building this site because of its specialization in static websites and its advantages in enhancing SEO performance. Tailwind CSS was chosen for its utility-first approach, enabling fast and efficient styling directly within HTML, leading to a highly customizable and responsive design. The layout leverages a flexible grid system that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
