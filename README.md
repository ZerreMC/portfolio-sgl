# CV Portfolio Project

## Project Analysis

### User Profile
The primary target user for this portfolio is a recruiter or hiring manager at a tech company who is looking to assess the potential of a university student for a front-end development role. This user expects to find clear and relevant information on the candidate's skills, academic background, and any technical proficiencies, as well as contact information to initiate potential interviews. The website is also aimed at technical leads or developers at companies who may want to evaluate the candidate for collaboration or internship opportunities.

### Information Architecture
The information on this single-page portfolio is structured to provide a seamless user experience. The page begins with a **Header** containing a navigation menu that links to key sections like "Home," "About Me," "Stack," and "Contact." The header also features a button for language switching (ENG/CAT). The **Main Section (Hero)** introduces the user with a greeting text and a concise description of the user's field of study, accompanied by action buttons that lead to the contact section and provide a downloadable PDF of the CV. 

The **‘About Me’** section follows, presenting a brief overview of the user's background. The **‘Technical Skills’** section lists the user’s qualifications, with subcategories for front-end languages, basic backend knowledge, and other supporting tools. Finally, the **‘Contact’** section is designed to encourage interaction, displaying a welcoming message and icons for LinkedIn, GitHub, and email to facilitate communication. The **Footer** closes the page with a copyright note.

### Visual Design
For this project, I focused on creating a visual aesthetic that is both modern and engaging, aimed at reflecting the creativity and professionalism of a front-end developer. The color palette chosen includes a dark theme with neon-like gradient accents, giving the portfolio a sleek, contemporary feel commonly seen in blockchain and tech-based projects. This design decision was inspired by the need to capture attention while maintaining readability and professionalism.

Typography plays a critical role, with a combination of sans-serif fonts that ensure clarity and align with current web design trends. I opted for Astro for building the site due to its optimization for static web pages and SEO capabilities. Tailwind CSS was chosen for rapid and efficient styling directly in the HTML, maintaining the page’s responsiveness and allowing for minimal external CSS file dependencies. The layout is structured with a responsive grid to accommodate different screen sizes, ensuring the page looks polished on both desktop and mobile views.
